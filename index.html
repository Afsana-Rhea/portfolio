  <h2> <em> About Me </em> </h2>
  <p> My name is Afsana Ria Miji and I grew up in Queens. I am eldest of 3 and am trying to be someone who is more giving and reliable. I want to make sure that the people I come in contact with feel seen, and are seen, though I am careless at times. The jobs that I have had are, nanny, au pair, early education english teacher, insurance sales person, office manager, receptionist, sales person, yoga instructor, writer, online store owner, social media marketer and very soon to be web developer.</p>
  <p> I am a 28 year old devotee of life. I live to connect with my surroundings and overcome anything that does not serve me.  </p>

  <h2><em> Past Experiences </em> </h2>
  <p> I started 3 of own e- commerce business with no prior experience in an attempt to diversify my income sources. maybe spreading out my attentions wasn't the best move, but it allowed me to see what I was good at and what took off the most. It is something I still dabble with and hope to move forward with. Todau I reliazed my experience with web development will allow me to create my own e commerce sights instead of using 3rd part sites like ebay or etsy. </p>
  <p> In two years, I went from never having done yoga to getting my certification in kid's yoga. I creating a community I was tightly bonded with and made me feel like I was a part of. They were people I had a lot in common with on a soul level and wanted the same things out of life that I did. It built my confidence in myself in the ability I had to not only create friendships and meaningful relationshsips, but in my ability to learn something new and excel and create a new identity for myself. </p>

  <article id="hobbies">
  <h2><em> Hobbies </em> </h2>
  <p> I love old black and white movies and reading when it rains. I love the blues and my record player. I love dried flowers and using them to make tinctures and smelling old musty pages. I love using essential oils and herbs to create potions, ie hand creams and face oils. I love taking different parts and using them to make something that is not only cute, but heals and makes itself useful. I love reusing and repurposing. I love foraging and connecting to the land, and learning about how we came to be. I love daydreaming about being a hermit in nature covered in wildfloweres, creaks and streams, misty falls and clover and moss covered hills. Maybe a secret elf or knome or nymph hiding behing a bramble, peaking while I write my book on my typewriter and brew my tea on an old kettle. I love wine and good food and laughter on quiet evenings in the fall; Picnics in the shade in summer. I like to light candles and burn incense.  </p>
  <p> I like to give the people that mean the world to me the short time that we have on this earth. I like to learn about the people that came before and why they did the things that they did an why we do the things that we do. I love to accomplish great feets in small increments, so it takes me by suprise when I look back and see what I accomplished and where I came from.   </p>
